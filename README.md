# shortcircuit

This demo inspired by [here(GFW)](https://program-think.blogspot.com/2019/03/Why-Thinking-Hard-So-Hard.html) and `||` operation in the CS, we just implement a simple demo to indicate that.

## Point

- two events operate by `or` operation
- this two event indicate different operation
- implement by Rust with simple code
- coming soon...

## Run

`./hust event`
